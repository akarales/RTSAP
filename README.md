Architecture Overview
1. Data Streaming and Ingestion Service
Technology: Apache Kafka
Purpose: Handles low-latency data streams from Bloomberg feeds, Reuters APIs, and financial news sources.
Enhancements:

Tiered Storage: Archive older messages in MinIO/S3.
Schema Registry: Ensure schema consistency.
Kafka Streams vs. Flink: Use Kafka Streams for lightweight event processing and Flink for complex stateful tasks.

2. Stream Processing Services
Technologies: Apache Flink & Apache Spark Streaming
Flink Purpose: Real-time Complex Event Processing (CEP) for market analytics and pattern detection.
Helm Chart: flink/flink
Enhancements: Autoscaling with Kubernetes HPA, checkpointing in MinIO.
Spark Streaming Purpose: Real-time processing of micro-batches for insights into stock prices and volatility detection.
Use Case: Sliding windows, rolling averages, and market event detection from Kafka streams.
3. Batch Processing Service
Technology: Apache Spark
Purpose: Large-scale batch processing for backtesting, risk modeling, and historical analysis.
Enhancements:

Adaptive Query Execution (AQE): Real-time query optimization.
MLflow Integration: Track and manage ML experiments.
MLlib: Use MLlib for financial models like regression, clustering, and anomaly detection.

4. Data Storage Services
Technologies:

MongoDB: Store unstructured data (e.g., news insights).
PostgreSQL: Manage transactional data.
TimescaleDB: Store time-series data (e.g., stock trades).
Apache HBase: Provide real-time access to historical datasets.
Apache Cassandra: Ensure high availability with distributed storage.
Apache Parquet & Avro: Optimize big data storage and serialization.
Enhancements: Use Apache Atlas for end-to-end data lineage tracking.

5. Distributed File System
Technology: MinIO
Purpose: Provides S3-compatible object storage for large datasets.
Enhancements: Versioning, erasure coding for fault tolerance.
6. Notebook Service
Technology: JupyterHub
Purpose: Interactive environment for financial model development and data exploration.
7. Data Integration and ETL Services
Technologies: Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka Connect
Purpose: Automate data flows between systems for seamless integration.
8. Machine Learning and AI Services
Technologies: Apache Mahout, Apache MXNet, Apache OpenNLP
Purpose: Provide scalable ML algorithms, deep learning, and NLP for predictive analytics and sentiment analysis.
8.1. Apache Spark MLlib
Purpose: Apache Spark MLlib provides scalable and distributed machine learning algorithms for regression, classification, clustering, and more. It is particularly well-suited for processing large-scale data and integrates seamlessly with Spark Streaming.
Key Features of Spark MLlib

Support for Various Algorithms: Regression, classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering.
Data Preprocessing: Feature extraction, transformation, and selection.
Pipeline Support: Easy construction of machine learning workflows.
Model Persistence: Save and load models in a variety of formats.

Example Use Cases:

Linear Regression: Predict stock prices based on multiple features.
Logistic Regression: Classify whether a stock's price will increase or decrease based on historical data.
Decision Trees: Predict market movements based on various financial indicators.
K-Means Clustering: Segment stocks based on their performance metrics.
Collaborative Filtering (ALS): Recommend stocks to users based on their ratings.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality of stock performance features.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using cross-validation.

9. Workflow Management Service
Technology: Argo Workflows
Purpose: Orchestrate complex data pipelines with dependency handling and real-time ETL job management.
10. Monitoring and Observability Stack
Technologies: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
Purpose: Collect metrics, visualize data, and aggregate logs for real-time observability.
11. Data Governance and Quality Services
Technologies: Apache Atlas, Apache Griffin
Purpose: Track data lineage with Atlas and ensure data quality with Griffin for profiling and anomaly detection.
12. Vector Database Service
Technology: Qdrant
Purpose: Perform similarity search and recommendations using vector-based operations.
13. Search and In-Memory Services
Technologies: Apache Solr, Lucene, Apache Ignite, Apache ZooKeeper
Purpose: Provide full-text search, in-memory computing, and distributed coordination for high-performance analytics.
14. Kubernetes Cluster Management
Technologies: Minikube, k9s
Purpose: Manage and monitor Kubernetes-based deployments for the RTSAP platform.
